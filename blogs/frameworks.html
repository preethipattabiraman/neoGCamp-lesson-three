            <h3>Confusions among beginners</h3>
            <img class="clib-article-image" src="/images/framwork.jpeg" />
            <p class="clib-article-content">When I learnt jQuery, it became outdated.</p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">When I learnt Angular, it became React.</p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">And now it's Blitz.</p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">A framework is like a foundation, on which programs can be written. It
                abstracts certain processes that are actually important, but not when you're building a mission critical
                application.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">Consider the process of building an MVC application using Java and Tomcat.
                You do not have Spring. So, the developer has to identify the required dependencies and add them in
                corresponding folders and build it. Every time WAR/JAR should be created and it should be deployed to
                Tomcat. Imagine doing them in a terminal. Although this is the proper way of getting to know things,
                it's cumbersome and time consuming. Hence IDEs, SpringBoot, Maven, Gradle came into picture.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">JavaScript in itself was built on TypeScript. The former is patient with
                data types, the latter is not. One of the many reasons not to use TypeScript is that it becomes messy
                over a period of time. If there is a pressing need to use TypeScript, Babel plugin will do that for it.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">JavaScript, on the other hand, is continuously evolving. It is such a
                ‘super’ superset that writing a framework on top of it is easy. Abstracting code using JavaScript is
                neat. Flexibility is JavaScript’s biggest asset.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">That said, when you need to create complex UI elements, JavaScript would
                need bigger codes. Template Literals might help you, although not always. If the application is an SPA
                and simpler, JavaScript will suffice. Even for bigger applications, when the basic APIs are clearly
                written and well-formed, vanilla JavaScript is enough.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">One word.

                <strong>Performance.</strong>

            </p>
            <img class="clib-article-image" src="/images/performance-test.jpg" />
            <p class="clib-article-content">Although jQuery might be user-friendly and easy on the eye, JavaScript is
                actually quicker.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">JavaScript is standalone - a combination of ECMAScript and DOM. This combination of power can help to do many things on the front end. 

            For a beginner, the enormous number of frameworks confuses. What to learn? 
            One you master vanillaJS, learning a framework becomes easy.
