            <h3>From Coder to Writer and doing both</h3>
            <img class="clib-article-image" src="/images/contentWriter.png" />
            <p class="clib-article-content">I recently switched from Web Development to Technical Writing. I did this to spend more quality time with my son.</p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">That said, my transition was and is, difficult. I see that codes are omnipresent and I feel forlorn. I want to make my hands dirty. I want to learn new frameworks. I want to keep on coding. And to do all these, I have to trade my little time with my son.</p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">He just now turned 3. Mischievous, tenacious and marvellous. That's my toddler for you. He knows I code, he has his own laptop on which he 'logins', he knows I get calls, and yet, he wants me to play.</p>

            <p class="clib-article-content">But I want to play with JavaScript. 
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">JavaScript and its frameworks are just like a toddler: growing exponentially. We think we know one thing about them, they decide to surprise us. My son was just as mysterious as JavaScript. 
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">I was putting time to learn Web Development, but not enough for my son. That pained me.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">And then I realised, I can learn by writing. Because to write, I need to learn well. But if I prioritise my work, I will miss my son's growth and happiness. 
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">Writing is and always will be my passion. Technical writing actually combines the best of the both worlds. But it took me many days to accept this. For me to make peace with this.
            </p>
            <p class="clib-article-content">

                <strong>And so... Hence I begin. The journey to be a good mom and a writer. Wish me luck!</strong>
